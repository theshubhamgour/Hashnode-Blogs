Welcome to the next phase of your Git journey! In Phase 5, we're diving deeper into essential Git commands that will make you a Git pro.

## Log Commands

**Command 1:** `git status`

Before making any moves, it's always a good idea to check the lay of the land. `git status` is your friend. It tells you what's happening in your Git world.

Example:

```plaintext
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git status
```

**Command 2:** `git diff`

Need to see the differences in your files? `git diff` is the tool. Whether you want to compare your working directory with the last commit or check the changes in a specific file, this command has you covered.

Example:

```plaintext
git diff <filename>
```

**Command 3:** `git diff --staged`

So, you've staged some changes, but you're not quite ready to commit them. Use `git diff --staged` to review what's about to be committed. It's like a final check before sealing the deal.

Example:

```plaintext
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git diff --staged
```

**Command 4:** `git diff commitA..commitB`

Ever wondered how two versions of a file differ? This command helps you compare them using their commit IDs. Understanding the changes between two specific points in time can be incredibly useful.

Example:

```plaintext
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git log file1.txt
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git diff d98f65..d0d054
```

### **Deleting a File**

Deleting a file in Git is a two-step process. First, use `git rm <filename>` to remove it. Then, commit your change with a descriptive comment, and finally, push the update to your repository.

Example:

```plaintext
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git rm file10.txt 
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git commit -m "Deleted file10.txt - NA Cached"
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git push
```

### **Renaming a File/Folder**

Change file or folder names seamlessly with `git mv`. This command simplifies renaming while keeping the history intact. After renaming, commit the change and push it to your repository.

Example:

```plaintext
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git mv git-file file10.txt
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git commit -m "Renamed: git-file -> file10.txt"
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git push
```

### **Carry History for a New File**

Sometimes, you'll want to carry over the history of an old file to a new one. Use `git log --follow <new-name>` to do just that. This can be especially handy when you're restructuring your project.

Example:

```plaintext
theshubhamgour@ubuntuM1:~/Desktop/git-hash$ git log --follow file10.txt
```

With these commands and examples, you're well-equipped to navigate the Git universe with confidence. Git empowers you to track changes, collaborate effectively, and ensure your project's history is crystal clear.
