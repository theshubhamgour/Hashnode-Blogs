Hi Everyone and Welcome back On the Day 3 of our DevOps journey, we're diving deep into the heart of Linux to unravel its remarkable commands. Today, we'll discover how to interact with files and directories like seasoned pros. Let's dive in with practical examples.

## **Viewing File Contents:**

Ever been curious about the contents of a file? Linux provides the `cat` command to satisfy your curiosity. Just type `cat filename`, and you'll see the magic unfold:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ cat content.txt
```

This reveals the entire content of the file `content.txt`. It's like opening a treasure chest to find the hidden gems inside.

## **Changing File Permissions:**

Linux empowers you to control who can access your files. The `chmod` command is your key to managing permissions. For example:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ chmod 600 content.txt 
```

This command changes the permissions of the file `content.txt` so that only the owner can read and modify it, while others have no access.

## **Reviewing Command History:**

The `history` command is your time machine, letting you travel back in time to revisit the commands you've used. Just type:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ history
```

It's like flipping through the pages of a diary filled with your digital adventures, showing all the commands you've run.

## **Removing Directories:**

If you need to tidy up your digital space by removing directories, Linux offers two powerful commands: `rmdir` for empty directories and `rm -r` for directories with content. For example:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ rm -rf siddharth/
```

This command deletes the directory `siddharth` along with all its contents, just like cleaning out an old attic.

## **Creating and Viewing Files:**

Creating a new file is as simple as pie with the `touch` command. To create a file named "fruits.txt," simply enter:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ touch fruits.txt
```

Once created, you can view the file's contents using the `cat` command:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ cat fruits.txt 
```

## **Adding Content to Files:**

The `echo` command helps you add content to your files. For example, to create a "devops.txt" file and populate it with a list of fruits, use:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ echo -e "Apple\nMango\nBanana\nCherry" > devops.txt
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698126464108/9b7420c3-66d3-4950-adf5-a61ea64bf0dc.png align="left")

This command adds each fruit on a new line within "devops.txt."

## **Displaying Top and Bottom Lines:**

If you're looking for a quick overview of a file, Linux offers two handy commands: `head` and `tail`. To display the top three fruits from "fruits.txt," use:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ head -n 3 fruits.txt
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698126660375/87a85260-b50e-4ff0-854b-ee40f6baa477.png align="center")

This provides a glimpse of the first three lines in the file.

Now, to show only the bottom three fruits from a file, you can use the `tail` command with the `-n` option to specify the number of lines you want to display. Here's how you can do it:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ tail -n 3 fruits.txt
```

This command will display the last three lines from the "fruits.txt" file, which is like plucking the last three fruits from your basket. It's a useful way to view the end of a file, especially when you have a large document or log file.

## **Creating and Comparing Another File:**

You can create another file, like "Colors.txt," using the `touch` command. Then, add content using `echo`. For instance:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ echo -e "Red\nPink\nWhite\nBlack\nBlue\nOrange" > Colors.txt
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698126812143/c25288d5-b8e2-47d1-a923-e5bef05fe8d0.png align="left")

To compare "fruits.txt" and "Colors.txt" and see the differences, the `diff` command is your guide:

```plaintext
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-1-21 ~]$ diff fruits.txt Colors.txt
```
