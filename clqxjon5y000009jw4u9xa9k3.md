## Some terms for your Knowledge

**What is Pipeline -** A pipeline is a collection of steps or jobs interlinked in a sequence.

**Declarative:** Declarative is a more recent and advanced implementation of a pipeline as a code.

**Scripted:** Scripted was the first and most traditional implementation of the pipeline as a code in Jenkins. It was designed as a general-purpose DSL (Domain Specific Language) built with Groovy.

# Why you should have a Pipeline

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a [`Jenkinsfile`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile)) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository.  
This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-code"; treating the CD pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.

**Creating a** `Jenkinsfile` and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:

* Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests.
    
* Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).
    

# Pipeline syntax

```abap
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# **Creating your first Pipeline**

1. Provide a name for your new item (e.g. **Dec-Pipeline**) and select **Pipeline**

2. Now Select Pipeline and enter the below pipeline to validate the execution steps
    
    ```abap
    pipeline {
        agent any
    
        stages {
            stage('Initalisation Phase') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        echo 'Running Stage 1...'
                    }
                }
            }
    
            stage('Staging') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        echo 'Running Stage 2...'
                    }
                }
            }
    
            stage('Execution Phase') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        echo 'Running Stage 3...'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    
        post {
            success {
                echo 'Pipeline executed successfully!'
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Let's break down the provided declarative Jenkins pipeline:
    
    ```abap
    pipeline {
        agent any
    ```
    
    * `pipeline`: This keyword marks the beginning of the pipeline block.
        
    * `agent any`: This specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent (Jenkins node). The `any` keyword means it is not restricted to a specific agent.
        
    
    ```abap
    stages {
            stage('Initialization Phase') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        echo 'Running Stage 1...'
                    }
                }
            }
    
            stage('Staging') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        echo 'Running Stage 2...'
                    }
                }
            }
    
            stage('Execution Phase') {
                steps {
                    script {
                        echo 'Running Stage 3...'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ```
    
    * `stages`: This block defines the different stages of the pipeline. In this example, there are three stages: `Initialization Phase`, `Staging`, and `Execution Phase`.
        
    * `steps`: Each stage can have one or more steps defined in the `steps` block. In this case, there is a single step in each stage.
        
    * `script`: The `script` block allows you to execute arbitrary Groovy script. In each stage, it's used to print a message using the `echo` command.
        
    
    ```abap
    post {
            success {
                echo 'Pipeline executed successfully!'
            }
        }
    ```
    
    * `post`: This block is used to define post-build actions or conditions. In this case, there is a `success` block, which will be executed if the pipeline completes successfully.
        
    * `echo 'Pipeline executed successfully!'`: Inside the `success` block, it prints a success message using the `echo` command.
        
    
    In summary, this pipeline has three stages with corresponding messages, and it prints a success message if all the stages complete successfully.
